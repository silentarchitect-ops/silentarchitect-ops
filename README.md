## 🧠 Who Am I?

I’m Ravi Kumar Singh — known here as **`silentarchitect-ops`**, a cloud-native systems builder, data migration specialist, and OSS Agent system creator.

In my tech-verse:
- I **migrate financial systems** from on-prem HiveQL → BigQuery (20TB+)
- I **design serverless cloud infra** using Terraform & GCP
- I build **LLM-based AgentOps + RAG architectures**
- I operate **quietly but precisely**, with a mission-first mindset

## 🔮 Arc 2025: OSS Agent RAG Projects

Building **Open Source AgentOps + RAG Platforms** using LLM orchestration and GCP serverless.

| Project Title | Summary |
|---------------|---------|
| `video-rag-mcp` | 🧠 RAG over transcribed videos using MCP and LangChain |
| `corrective-rag` | 🛡️ Compliance-aware agentic RAG for GFCC/SLPM datasets |
| `voice-rag-agent` | 🎙️ Real-time RAG + TTS via voice interaction |
| `fastest-bq-rag` | 🚀 OLAP-grade RAG stack on BigQuery for analytics |
| `human-agent-core` | 🤖 Human-like memory for multi-turn agents |

> **Coming Soon**: Each project will have its own repository, animated README, and OSS release.

## ✨ Philosophy of a Silent Architect
🌱 Observe quietly.
⚒️ Build with intent.
🧘 Scale with simplicity.

> "Not every warrior makes noise.  
> Some just write DAGs and let them run the world."
